# Welcome to the Train Booking System!

This web application built on ASP.NET Core MVC is designed to streamline the process of booking train seats for travelers. Our system consists of intuitive modules catering to both passengers and administrators.

## Admin Module:

In addition to passenger services, our system includes an Admin Module tailored for administrators. Admins have the authority to manage various aspects of the train service efficiently.

Admins can add new trains to the system, specifying their schedules and available seat types. They can also manage existing bookings, ensuring smooth operations and optimal utilization of resources. Furthermore, administrators have the flexibility to adjust seat availability and make necessary modifications to accommodate changing demand patterns.

Overall, our Train Booking System aims to provide a user-friendly interface for passengers to book their train seats hassle-free while empowering administrators with robust tools to oversee and manage the train service effectively.

## User Module:

For passengers, the User Module offers a seamless experience for booking train seats to their desired destinations. Users can explore various destinations served by our trains and select their preferred one. Once the destination is chosen, they can easily browse through available seat types, including first class, second class, or sleeper, to book their preferred seats for the journey.

Furthermore, passengers can conveniently manage their bookings, including cancellation if their plans change. The refund for cancellations is determined based on the number of days left before the departure date, ensuring fair treatment for all passengers.
